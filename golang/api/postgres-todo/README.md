# To-do API

I made this simple API to get more in-depth on my Go studies


## What I learned?

- To use the package [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for configuration files
- To use the package [go-chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) for HTTP services
- Running postgres in a docker container
- To handle with multiple packages
- Better file organization
